|* Demonstration program to compute the 32-bit CRC used as the frame  *|

|* and FED-STD-1003, the U.S. versions of CCITT's X.25 link-level     *|
|* protocol).  The 32-bit FCS was added via the Federal Register,     *|
|* 1 June 1982, p.23798.  I presume but don't know for certain that   *|
|* this polynomial is or will be included in CCITT V.41, which        *|
|* defines the 16-bit CRC (often called CRC-CCITT) polynomial.  FIPS  *|
|* PUB 78 says that the 32-bit FCS reduces otherwise undetected       *|
|* errors by a factor of 10^-5 over 16-bit FCS.                       *|

ELF(5)                    Linux Programmer's Manual                   ELF(5) \
NAME         top \
 \
       elf - format of Executable and Linking Format (ELF) files \
SYNOPSIS         top \
 \
       #include <elf.h> \
DESCRIPTION         top \
 \
       The header file <elf.h> defines the format of ELF executable binary \
       files.  Amongst these files are normal executable files, relocatable \
       object files, core files, and shared objects. \
 \
       An executable file using the ELF file format consists of an ELF \
       header, followed by a program header table or a section header table, \
       or both.  The ELF header is always at offset zero of the file.  The \
       program header table and the section header table's offset in the \
       file are defined in the ELF header.  The two tables describe the rest \
       of the particularities of the file. \
 \
       This header file describes the above mentioned headers as C \
       structures and also includes structures for dynamic sections, \
       relocation sections and symbol tables. \
 \
       The following types are used for N-bit architectures (N=32,64, ElfN \
       stands for Elf32 or Elf64, uintN_t stands for uint32_t or uint64_t): \
 \
           ElfN_Addr       Unsigned program address, uintN_t \
           ElfN_Off        Unsigned file offset, uintN_t \
           ElfN_Section    Unsigned section index, uint16_t \
           ElfN_Versym     Unsigned version symbol information, uint16_t \
           Elf_Byte        unsigned char \
           ElfN_Half       uint16_t \
           ElfN_Sword      int32_t \
           ElfN_Word       uint32_t \
           ElfN_Sxword     int64_t \
           ElfN_Xword      uint64_t \
 \
       (Note: The *BSD terminology is a bit different.  There, Elf64_Half is \
       twice as large as Elf32_Half, and Elf64Quarter is used for uint16_t. \
       In order to avoid confusion these types are replaced by explicit ones \
       in the below.) \
 \
       All data structures that the file format defines follow the natural \
       size and alignment guidelines for the relevant class.  If necessary, \
       data structures contain explicit padding to ensure 4-byte alignment \
       for 4-byte objects, to force structure sizes to a multiple of 4, and \
       so on. \
 \
       The ELF header is described by the type Elf32_Ehdr or Elf64_Ehdr: \
 \
           #define EI_NIDENT 16 \
 \
           typedef struct { \
               unsigned char e_ident[EI_NIDENT]; \
               uint16_t      e_type; \
               uint16_t      e_machine; \
               uint32_t      e_version; \
               ElfN_Addr     e_entry; \
               ElfN_Off      e_phoff; \
               ElfN_Off      e_shoff; \
               uint32_t      e_flags; \
               uint16_t      e_ehsize; \
               uint16_t      e_phentsize; \
               uint16_t      e_phnum; \
               uint16_t      e_shentsize; \
               uint16_t      e_shnum; \
               uint16_t      e_shstrndx; \
           } ElfN_Ehdr; \
 \
       The fields have the following meanings: \
 \
       e_ident   This array of bytes specifies how to interpret the file, \
                 independent of the processor or the file's remaining \
                 contents.  Within this array everything is named by macros, \
                 which start with the prefix EI_ and may contain values \
                 which start with the prefix ELF.  The following macros are \
                 defined: \
 \
                 EI_MAG0  The first byte of the magic number.  It must be \
                          filled with ELFMAG0.  (0: 0x7f) \
 \
                 EI_MAG1  The second byte of the magic number.  It must be \
                          filled with ELFMAG1.  (1: 'E') \
 \
                 EI_MAG2  The third byte of the magic number.  It must be \
                          filled with ELFMAG2.  (2: 'L') \
 \
                 EI_MAG3  The fourth byte of the magic number.  It must be \
                          filled with ELFMAG3.  (3: 'F') \
 \
                 EI_CLASS The fifth byte identifies the architecture for \
                          this binary: \
 \
                          ELFCLASSNONE  This class is invalid. \
                          ELFCLASS32    This defines the 32-bit \
                                        architecture.  It supports machines \
                                        with files and virtual address \
                                        spaces up to 4 Gigabytes. \
                          ELFCLASS64    This defines the 64-bit \
                                        architecture. \
 \
                 EI_DATA  The sixth byte specifies the data encoding of the \
                          processor-specific data in the file.  Currently, \
                          these encodings are supported: \
 \
                          ELFDATANONE   Unknown data format. \
                          ELFDATA2LSB   Two's complement, little-endian. \
                          ELFDATA2MSB   Two's complement, big-endian. \
 \
                 EI_VERSION \
                          The seventh byte is the version number of the ELF \
                          specification: \
 \
                          EV_NONE       Invalid version. \
                          EV_CURRENT    Current version. \
 \
                 EI_OSABI The eighth byte identifies the operating system \
                          and ABI to which the object is targeted.  Some \
                          fields in other ELF structures have flags and \
                          values that have platform-specific meanings; the \
                          interpretation of those fields is determined by \
                          the value of this byte.  For example: \
 \
                          ELFOSABI_NONE        Same as ELFOSABI_SYSV \
                          ELFOSABI_SYSV        UNIX System V ABI \
                          ELFOSABI_HPUX        HP-UX ABI \
                          ELFOSABI_NETBSD      NetBSD ABI \
                          ELFOSABI_LINUX       Linux ABI \
                          ELFOSABI_SOLARIS     Solaris ABI \
                          ELFOSABI_IRIX        IRIX ABI \
                          ELFOSABI_FREEBSD     FreeBSD ABI \
                          ELFOSABI_TRU64       TRU64 UNIX ABI \
                          ELFOSABI_ARM         ARM architecture ABI \
                          ELFOSABI_STANDALONE  Stand-alone (embedded) ABI \
 \
                 EI_ABIVERSION \
                          The ninth byte identifies the version of the ABI \
                          to which the object is targeted.  This field is \
                          used to distinguish among incompatible versions of \
                          an ABI.  The interpretation of this version number \
                          is dependent on the ABI identified by the EI_OSABI \
                          field.  Applications conforming to this \
                          specification use the value 0. \
 \
                 EI_PAD   Start of padding.  These bytes are reserved and \
                          set to zero.  Programs which read them should \
                          ignore them.  The value for EI_PAD will change in \
                          the future if currently unused bytes are given \
                          meanings. \
 \
                 EI_NIDENT \
                          The size of the e_ident array. \
 \
       e_type    This member of the structure identifies the object file \
                 type: \
 \
                 ET_NONE         An unknown type. \
                 ET_REL          A relocatable file. \
                 ET_EXEC         An executable file. \
                 ET_DYN          A shared object. \
                 ET_CORE         A core file. \
 \
       e_machine This member specifies the required architecture for an \
                 individual file.  For example: \
 \
                 EM_NONE         An unknown machine \
                 EM_M32          AT&T WE 32100 \

                 EM_SPARC32PLUS  SPARC with enhanced instruction set \
                 EM_PPC          PowerPC \
                 EM_PPC64        PowerPC 64-bit \

                 EM_SPARCV9      SPARC v9 64-bit \
                 EM_IA_64        Intel Itanium \
                 EM_X86_64       AMD x86-64 \
                 EM_VAX          DEC Vax \
 \
       e_version This member identifies the file version: \
 \
                 EV_NONE         Invalid version \
                 EV_CURRENT      Current version \
 \
       e_entry   This member gives the virtual address to which the system \
                 first transfers control, thus starting the process.  If the \
                 file has no associated entry point, this member holds zero. \
 \
       e_phoff   This member holds the program header table's file offset in \
                 bytes.  If the file has no program header table, this \
                 member holds zero. \
 \
       e_shoff   This member holds the section header table's file offset in \
                 bytes.  If the file has no section header table, this \
                 member holds zero. \
 \
       e_flags   This member holds processor-specific flags associated with \
                 the file.  Flag names take the form EF_`machine_flag'. \
                 Currently, no flags have been defined. \
 \
       e_ehsize  This member holds the ELF header's size in bytes. \
 \
       e_phentsize \
                 This member holds the size in bytes of one entry in the \
                 file's program header table; all entries are the same size. \
 \
       e_phnum   This member holds the number of entries in the program \
                 header table.  Thus the product of e_phentsize and e_phnum \
                 gives the table's size in bytes.  If a file has no program \
                 header, e_phnum holds the value zero. \
 \
                 If the number of entries in the program header table is \
                 larger than or equal to PN_XNUM (0xffff), this member holds \
                 PN_XNUM (0xffff) and the real number of entries in the \
                 program header table is held in the sh_info member of the \
                 initial entry in section header table.  Otherwise, the \
                 sh_info member of the initial entry contains the value \
                 zero. \
 \
                 PN_XNUM  This is defined as 0xffff, the largest number \
                          e_phnum can have, specifying where the actual \
                          number of program headers is assigned. \
 \
       e_shentsize \
                 This member holds a sections header's size in bytes.  A \
                 section header is one entry in the section header table; \
                 all entries are the same size. \
 \
       e_shnum   This member holds the number of entries in the section \
                 header table.  Thus the product of e_shentsize and e_shnum \
                 gives the section header table's size in bytes.  If a file \
                 has no section header table, e_shnum holds the value of \
                 zero. \
 \
                 If the number of entries in the section header table is \
                 larger than or equal to SHN_LORESERVE (0xff00), e_shnum \
                 holds the value zero and the real number of entries in the \
                 section header table is held in the sh_size member of the \
                 initial entry in section header table.  Otherwise, the \
                 sh_size member of the initial entry in the section header \
                 table holds the value zero. \
 \
       e_shstrndx \
                 This member holds the section header table index of the \
                 entry associated with the section name string table.  If \
                 the file has no section name string table, this member \
                 holds the value SHN_UNDEF. \
 \
                 If the index of section name string table section is larger \
                 than or equal to SHN_LORESERVE (0xff00), this member holds \
                 SHN_XINDEX (0xffff) and the real index of the section name \
                 string table section is held in the sh_link member of the \
                 initial entry in section header table.  Otherwise, the \
                 sh_link member of the initial entry in section header table \
                 contains the value zero. \
 \
       An executable or shared object file's program header table is an \
       array of structures, each describing a segment or other information \
       the system needs to prepare the program for execution.  An object \
       file segment contains one or more sections.  Program headers are \
       meaningful only for executable and shared object files.  A file \
       specifies its own program header size with the ELF header's \
       e_phentsize and e_phnum members.  The ELF program header is described \
       by the type Elf32_Phdr or Elf64_Phdr depending on the architecture: \
 \
           typedef struct { \
               uint32_t   p_type; \
               Elf32_Off  p_offset; \
               Elf32_Addr p_vaddr; \
               Elf32_Addr p_paddr; \
               uint32_t   p_filesz; \
               uint32_t   p_memsz; \
               uint32_t   p_flags; \
               uint32_t   p_align; \
           } Elf32_Phdr; \
 \
           typedef struct { \
               uint32_t   p_type; \
               uint32_t   p_flags; \
               Elf64_Off  p_offset; \
               Elf64_Addr p_vaddr; \
               Elf64_Addr p_paddr; \
               uint64_t   p_filesz; \
               uint64_t   p_memsz; \
               uint64_t   p_align; \
           } Elf64_Phdr; \
 \
       The main difference between the 32-bit and the 64-bit program header \
       lies in the location of the p_flags member in the total struct. \
 \
       p_type    This member of the structure indicates what kind of segment \
                 this array element describes or how to interpret the array \
                 element's information. \
 \
                 PT_NULL     The array element is unused and the other \
                             members' values are undefined.  This lets the \
                             program header have ignored entries. \
 \
                 PT_LOAD     The array element specifies a loadable segment, \
                             described by p_filesz and p_memsz.  The bytes \
                             from the file are mapped to the beginning of \
                             the memory segment.  If the segment's memory \
                             size p_memsz is larger than the file size \
                             p_filesz, the extra bytes are defined to hold \
                             the value 0 and to follow the segment's \
                             initialized area.  The file size may not be \
                             larger than the memory size.  Loadable segment \
                             entries in the program header table appear in \
                             ascending order, sorted on the p_vaddr member. \
 \
                 PT_DYNAMIC  The array element specifies dynamic linking \
                             information. \
 \
                 PT_INTERP   The array element specifies the location and \
                             size of a null-terminated pathname to invoke as \
                             an interpreter.  This segment type is \
                             meaningful only for executable files (though it \
                             may occur for shared objects).  However it may \
                             not occur more than once in a file.  If it is \
                             present, it must precede any loadable segment \
                             entry. \
 \
                 PT_NOTE     The array element specifies the location and \
                             size for auxiliary information. \
 \
                 PT_SHLIB    This segment type is reserved but has \
                             unspecified semantics.  Programs that contain \
                             an array element of this type do not conform to \
                             the ABI. \
 \
                 PT_PHDR     The array element, if present, specifies the \
                             location and size of the program header table \
                             itself, both in the file and in the memory \
                             image of the program.  This segment type may \
                             not occur more than once in a file.  Moreover, \
                             it may occur only if the program header table \
                             is part of the memory image of the program.  If \
                             it is present, it must precede any loadable \
                             segment entry. \
 \
                 PT_LOPROC, PT_HIPROC \
                             Values in the inclusive range [PT_LOPROC, \
                             PT_HIPROC] are reserved for processor-specific \
                             semantics. \
 \
                 PT_GNU_STACK \
                             GNU extension which is used by the Linux kernel \
                             to control the state of the stack via the flags \
                             set in the p_flags member. \
 \
       p_offset  This member holds the offset from the beginning of the file \
                 at which the first byte of the segment resides. \
 \
       p_vaddr   This member holds the virtual address at which the first \
                 byte of the segment resides in memory. \
 \
       p_paddr   On systems for which physical addressing is relevant, this \
                 member is reserved for the segment's physical address. \
                 Under BSD this member is not used and must be zero. \
 \
       p_filesz  This member holds the number of bytes in the file image of \
                 the segment.  It may be zero. \
 \
       p_memsz   This member holds the number of bytes in the memory image \
                 of the segment.  It may be zero. \
 \
       p_flags   This member holds a bit mask of flags relevant to the \
                 segment: \
 \
                 PF_X   An executable segment. \
                 PF_W   A writable segment. \
                 PF_R   A readable segment. \
 \
                 A text segment commonly has the flags PF_X and PF_R.  A \
                 data segment commonly has PF_X, PF_W, and PF_R. \
 \
       p_align   This member holds the value to which the segments are \
                 aligned in memory and in the file.  Loadable process \
                 segments must have congruent values for p_vaddr and \
                 p_offset, modulo the page size.  Values of zero and one \
                 mean no alignment is required.  Otherwise, p_align should \
                 be a positive, integral power of two, and p_vaddr should \
                 equal p_offset, modulo p_align. \
 \
       A file's section header table lets one locate all the file's \
       sections.  The section header table is an array of Elf32_Shdr or \
       Elf64_Shdr structures.  The ELF header's e_shoff member gives the \
       byte offset from the beginning of the file to the section header \
       table.  e_shnum holds the number of entries the section header table \
       contains.  e_shentsize holds the size in bytes of each entry. \
 \
       A section header table index is a subscript into this array.  Some \
       section header table indices are reserved: the initial entry and the \
       indices between SHN_LORESERVE and SHN_HIRESERVE.  The initial entry \
       is used in ELF extensions for e_phnum, e_shnum and e_strndx; in other \
       cases, each field in the initial entry is set to zero.  An object \
       file does not have sections for these special indices: \
 \
       SHN_UNDEF \
              This value marks an undefined, missing, irrelevant, or \
              otherwise meaningless section reference. \
 \
       SHN_LORESERVE \
              This value specifies the lower bound of the range of reserved \
              indices. \
 \
       SHN_LOPROC, SHN_HIPROC \
              Values greater in the inclusive range [SHN_LOPROC, SHN_HIPROC] \
              are reserved for processor-specific semantics. \
 \
       SHN_ABS \
              This value specifies the absolute value for the corresponding \
              reference.  For example, a symbol defined relative to section \
              number SHN_ABS has an absolute value and is not affected by \
              relocation. \
 \
       SHN_COMMON \
              Symbols defined relative to this section are common symbols, \
              such as FORTRAN COMMON or unallocated C external variables. \
 \
       SHN_HIRESERVE \
              This value specifies the upper bound of the range of reserved \
              indices.  The system reserves indices between SHN_LORESERVE \
              and SHN_HIRESERVE, inclusive.  The section header table does \
              not contain entries for the reserved indices. \
 \
       The section header has the following structure: \
 \
           typedef struct { \
               uint32_t   sh_name; \
               uint32_t   sh_type; \
               uint32_t   sh_flags; \
               Elf32_Addr sh_addr; \
               Elf32_Off  sh_offset; \
               uint32_t   sh_size; \
               uint32_t   sh_link; \
               uint32_t   sh_info; \
               uint32_t   sh_addralign; \
               uint32_t   sh_entsize; \
           } Elf32_Shdr; \
 \
           typedef struct { \

 \
       No real differences exist between the 32-bit and 64-bit section \
       headers. \
 \
       sh_name   This member specifies the name of the section.  Its value \
                 is an index into the section header string table section, \
                 giving the location of a null-terminated string. \
 \
       sh_type   This member categorizes the section's contents and \
                 semantics. \
 \
                 SHT_NULL       This value marks the section header as \
                                inactive.  It does not have an associated \
                                section.  Other members of the section \
                                header have undefined values. \
 \
                 SHT_PROGBITS   This section holds information defined by \
                                the program, whose format and meaning are \
                                determined solely by the program. \
 \
                 SHT_SYMTAB     This section holds a symbol table. \
                                Typically, SHT_SYMTAB provides symbols for \
                                link editing, though it may also be used for \
                                dynamic linking.  As a complete symbol \
                                table, it may contain many symbols \
                                unnecessary for dynamic linking.  An object \
                                file can also contain a SHT_DYNSYM section. \
 \
                 SHT_STRTAB     This section holds a string table.  An \
                                object file may have multiple string table \
                                sections. \
 \
                 SHT_RELA       This section holds relocation entries with \
                                explicit addends, such as type Elf32_Rela \
                                for the 32-bit class of object files.  An \
                                object may have multiple relocation \
                                sections. \
 \
                 SHT_HASH       This section holds a symbol hash table.  An \
                                object participating in dynamic linking must \
                                contain a symbol hash table.  An object file \
                                may have only one hash table. \
 \
                 SHT_DYNAMIC    This section holds information for dynamic \
                                linking.  An object file may have only one \
                                dynamic section. \
 \
                 SHT_NOTE       This section holds information that marks \
                                the file in some way. \
 \
                 SHT_NOBITS     A section of this type occupies no space in \
                                the file but otherwise resembles \
                                SHT_PROGBITS.  Although this section \
                                contains no bytes, the sh_offset member \
                                contains the conceptual file offset. \
 \
                 SHT_REL        This section holds relocation offsets \
                                without explicit addends, such as type \
                                Elf32_Rel for the 32-bit class of object \
                                files.  An object file may have multiple \
                                relocation sections. \
 \
                 SHT_SHLIB      This section is reserved but has unspecified \
                                semantics. \
 \
                 SHT_DYNSYM     This section holds a minimal set of dynamic \
                                linking symbols.  An object file can also \
                                contain a SHT_SYMTAB section. \
 \
                 SHT_LOPROC, SHT_HIPROC \
                                Values in the inclusive range [SHT_LOPROC, \
                                SHT_HIPROC] are reserved for processor- \
                                specific semantics. \
 \
                 SHT_LOUSER     This value specifies the lower bound of the \
                                range of indices reserved for application \
                                programs. \
 \
                 SHT_HIUSER     This value specifies the upper bound of the \
                                range of indices reserved for application \
                                programs.  Section types between SHT_LOUSER \
                                and SHT_HIUSER may be used by the \
                                application, without conflicting with \
                                current or future system-defined section \
                                types. \
 \
       sh_flags  Sections support one-bit flags that describe miscellaneous \
                 attributes.  If a flag bit is set in sh_flags, the \
                 attribute is on for the section.  Otherwise, the \
                 attribute is off or does not apply.  Undefined attributes \
                 are set to zero. \
 \
                 SHF_WRITE      This section contains data that should be \
                                writable during process execution. \
 \
                 SHF_ALLOC      This section occupies memory during process \
                                execution.  Some control sections do not \
                                reside in the memory image of an object \
                                file.  This attribute is off for those \
                                sections. \
 \
                 SHF_EXECINSTR  This section contains executable machine \
                                instructions. \
 \
                 SHF_MASKPROC   All bits included in this mask are reserved \
                                for processor-specific semantics. \
 \
       sh_addr   If this section appears in the memory image of a process, \
                 this member holds the address at which the section's first \
                 byte should reside.  Otherwise, the member contains zero. \
 \
       sh_offset This member's value holds the byte offset from the \
                 beginning of the file to the first byte in the section. \
                 One section type, SHT_NOBITS, occupies no space in the \
                 file, and its sh_offset member locates the conceptual \
                 placement in the file. \
 \
       sh_size   This member holds the section's size in bytes.  Unless the \
                 section type is SHT_NOBITS, the section occupies sh_size \
                 bytes in the file.  A section of type SHT_NOBITS may have a \
                 nonzero size, but it occupies no space in the file. \
 \
       sh_link   This member holds a section header table index link, whose \
                 interpretation depends on the section type. \
 \
       sh_info   This member holds extra information, whose interpretation \
                 depends on the section type. \
 \
       sh_addralign \
                 Some sections have address alignment constraints.  If a \
                 section holds a doubleword, the system must ensure \
                 doubleword alignment for the entire section.  That is, the \
                 value of sh_addr must be congruent to zero, modulo the \
                 value of sh_addralign.  Only zero and positive integral \
                 powers of two are allowed.  Values of zero or one mean the \
                 section has no alignment constraints. \
 \
       sh_entsize \
                 Some sections hold a table of fixed-sized entries, such as \
                 a symbol table.  For such a section, this member gives the \
                 size in bytes for each entry.  This member contains zero if \
                 the section does not hold a table of fixed-size entries. \
 \
       Various sections hold program and control information: \
 \
       .bss      This section holds uninitialized data that contributes to \
                 the program's memory image.  By definition, the system \
                 initializes the data with zeros when the program begins to \
                 run.  This section is of type SHT_NOBITS.  The attribute \
                 types are SHF_ALLOC and SHF_WRITE. \
 \

                 SHF_WRITE. \
 \
       .dynamic  This section holds dynamic linking information.  The \
                 section's attributes will include the SHF_ALLOC bit. \
                 Whether the SHF_WRITE bit is set is processor-specific. \
                 This section is of type SHT_DYNAMIC.  See the attributes \
                 above. \
 \
       .dynstr   This section holds strings needed for dynamic linking, most \
                 commonly the strings that represent the names associated \
                 with symbol table entries.  This section is of type \

 \
       .fini     This section holds executable instructions that contribute \
                 to the process termination code.  When a program exits \
                 normally the system arranges to execute the code in this \
                 section.  This section is of type SHT_PROGBITS.  The \
                 attributes used are SHF_ALLOC and SHF_EXECINSTR. \
 \

                 specific. \
 \
       .hash     This section holds a symbol hash table.  This section is of \
                 type SHT_HASH.  The attribute used is SHF_ALLOC. \
 \
       .init     This section holds executable instructions that contribute \
                 to the process initialization code.  When a program starts \
                 to run the system arranges to execute the code in this \
                 section before calling the main program entry point.  This \
                 section is of type SHT_PROGBITS.  The attributes used are \
                 SHF_ALLOC and SHF_EXECINSTR. \
 \
       .interp   This section holds the pathname of a program interpreter. \
                 If the file has a loadable segment that includes the \
                 section, the section's attributes will include the \
                 SHF_ALLOC bit.  Otherwise, that bit will be off.  This \
                 section is of type SHT_PROGBITS. \
 \
       .line     This section holds line number information for symbolic \
                 debugging, which describes the correspondence between the \
                 program source and the machine code.  The contents are \
                 unspecified.  This section is of type SHT_PROGBITS.  No \

 \
       .note     This section holds information in the Note Section \
                 format.  This section is of type SHT_NOTE.  No attribute \
                 types are used.  OpenBSD native executables usually contain \
                 a .note.openbsd.ident section to identify themselves, for \
                 the kernel to bypass any compatibility ELF binary emulation \
                 tests when loading the file. \
 \
       .note.GNU-stack \
                 This section is used in Linux object files for declaring \
                 stack attributes.  This section is of type SHT_PROGBITS. \
                 The only attribute used is SHF_EXECINSTR.  This indicates \
                 to the GNU linker that the object file requires an \
                 executable stack. \
 \
       .plt      This section holds the procedure linkage table.  This \
                 section is of type SHT_PROGBITS.  The attributes are \
                 processor-specific. \
 \
       .relNAME  This section holds relocation information as described \
                 below.  If the file has a loadable segment that includes \
                 relocation, the section's attributes will include the \
                 SHF_ALLOC bit.  Otherwise, the bit will be off.  By \
                 convention, NAME is supplied by the section to which the \
                 relocations apply.  Thus a relocation section for .text \
                 normally would have the name .rel.text.  This section is of \
                 type SHT_REL. \
 \
       .relaNAME This section holds relocation information as described \
                 below.  If the file has a loadable segment that includes \
                 relocation, the section's attributes will include the \
                 SHF_ALLOC bit.  Otherwise, the bit will be off.  By \
                 convention, NAME is supplied by the section to which the \
                 relocations apply.  Thus a relocation section for .text \
                 normally would have the name .rela.text.  This section is \
                 of type SHT_RELA. \
 \
       .rodata   This section holds read-only data that typically \
                 contributes to a nonwritable segment in the process image. \
                 This section is of type SHT_PROGBITS.  The attribute used \
                 is SHF_ALLOC. \
 \
       .rodata1  This section holds read-only data that typically \
                 contributes to a nonwritable segment in the process image. \
                 This section is of type SHT_PROGBITS.  The attribute used \
                 is SHF_ALLOC. \
 \
       .shstrtab This section holds section names.  This section is of type \
                 SHT_STRTAB.  No attribute types are used. \
 \
       .strtab   This section holds strings, most commonly the strings that \
                 represent the names associated with symbol table entries. \
                 If the file has a loadable segment that includes the symbol \
                 string table, the section's attributes will include the \
                 SHF_ALLOC bit.  Otherwise, the bit will be off.  This \
                 section is of type SHT_STRTAB. \
 \
       .symtab   This section holds a symbol table.  If the file has a \
                 loadable segment that includes the symbol table, the \
                 section's attributes will include the SHF_ALLOC bit. \
                 Otherwise, the bit will be off.  This section is of type \
                 SHT_SYMTAB. \
 \
       .text     This section holds the text, or executable instructions, \
                 of a program.  This section is of type SHT_PROGBITS.  The \
                 attributes used are SHF_ALLOC and SHF_EXECINSTR. \
 \
       String table sections hold null-terminated character sequences, \
       commonly called strings.  The object file uses these strings to \
       represent symbol and section names.  One references a string as an \
       index into the string table section.  The first byte, which is index \
       zero, is defined to hold a null byte ('\0').  Similarly, a string \
       table's last byte is defined to hold a null byte, ensuring null \
       termination for all strings. \
 \
       An object file's symbol table holds information needed to locate and \
       relocate a program's symbolic definitions and references.  A symbol \
       table index is a subscript into this array. \
 \
           typedef struct { \
               uint32_t      st_name; \

 \
       The 32-bit and 64-bit versions have the same members, just in a \
       different order. \
 \
       st_name   This member holds an index into the object file's symbol \
                 string table, which holds character representations of the \
                 symbol names.  If the value is nonzero, it represents a \
                 string table index that gives the symbol name.  Otherwise, \
                 the symbol has no name. \
 \
       st_value  This member gives the value of the associated symbol. \
 \
       st_size   Many symbols have associated sizes.  This member holds zero \
                 if the symbol has no size or an unknown size. \
 \
       st_info   This member specifies the symbol's type and binding \
                 attributes: \
 \
                 STT_NOTYPE  The symbol's type is not defined. \
 \
                 STT_OBJECT  The symbol is associated with a data object. \
 \
                 STT_FUNC    The symbol is associated with a function or \
                             other executable code. \
 \
                 STT_SECTION The symbol is associated with a section. \
                             Symbol table entries of this type exist \
                             primarily for relocation and normally have \
                             STB_LOCAL bindings. \
 \
                 STT_FILE    By convention, the symbol's name gives the name \
                             of the source file associated with the object \
                             file.  A file symbol has STB_LOCAL bindings, \
                             its section index is SHN_ABS, and it precedes \
                             the other STB_LOCAL symbols of the file, if it \
                             is present. \
 \
                 STT_LOPROC, STT_HIPROC \
                             Values in the inclusive range [STT_LOPROC, \
                             STT_HIPROC] are reserved for processor-specific \
                             semantics. \
 \
                 STB_LOCAL   Local symbols are not visible outside the \
                             object file containing their definition.  Local \
                             symbols of the same name may exist in multiple \
                             files without interfering with each other. \
 \
                 STB_GLOBAL  Global symbols are visible to all object files \
                             being combined.  One file's definition of a \
                             global symbol will satisfy another file's \
                             undefined reference to the same symbol. \
 \
                 STB_WEAK    Weak symbols resemble global symbols, but their \
                             definitions have lower precedence. \
 \
                 STB_LOPROC, STB_HIPROC \
                             Values in the inclusive range [STB_LOPROC, \
                             STB_HIPROC] are reserved for processor-specific \
                             semantics. \
 \
                 There are macros for packing and unpacking the binding and \
                 type fields: \
 \
                 ELF32_ST_BIND(info), ELF64_ST_BIND(info) \
                        Extract a binding from an st_info value. \
 \
                 ELF32_ST_TYPE(info), ELF64_ST_TYPE(info) \
                        Extract a type from an st_info value. \
 \
                 ELF32_ST_INFO(bind, type), ELF64_ST_INFO(bind, type) \
                        Convert a binding and a type into an st_info value. \
 \
       st_other  This member defines the symbol visibility. \
 \
                 STV_DEFAULT     Default symbol visibility rules.  Global \
                                 and weak symbols are available to other \
                                 modules; references in the local module can \
                                 be interposed by definitions in other \
                                 modules. \
                 STV_INTERNAL    Processor-specific hidden class. \
                 STV_HIDDEN      Symbol is unavailable to other modules; \
                                 references in the local module always \
                                 resolve to the local symbol (i.e., the \
                                 symbol can't be interposed by definitions \
                                 in other modules). \
                 STV_PROTECTED   Symbol is available to other modules, but \
                                 references in the local module always \
                                 resolve to the local symbol. \
 \
                 There are macros for extracting the visibility type: \
 \
                 ELF32_ST_VISIBILITY(other) or ELF64_ST_VISIBILITY(other) \
 \
       st_shndx  Every symbol table entry is defined in relation to some \
                 section.  This member holds the relevant section header \
                 table index. \
 \
       Relocation is the process of connecting symbolic references with \
       symbolic definitions.  Relocatable files must have information that \
       describes how to modify their section contents, thus allowing \
       executable and shared object files to hold the right information for \
       a process's program image.  Relocation entries are these data. \
 \
       Relocation structures that do not need an addend: \
 \
           typedef struct { \
               Elf32_Addr r_offset; \
               uint32_t   r_info; \
           } Elf32_Rel; \
 \
           typedef struct { \
               Elf64_Addr r_offset; \
               uint64_t   r_info; \
           } Elf64_Rel; \
 \
       Relocation structures that need an addend: \
 \
           typedef struct { \
               Elf32_Addr r_offset; \
               uint32_t   r_info; \
               int32_t    r_addend; \
           } Elf32_Rela; \
 \
           typedef struct { \
               Elf64_Addr r_offset; \
               uint64_t   r_info; \
               int64_t    r_addend; \
           } Elf64_Rela; \
 \
       r_offset  This member gives the location at which to apply the \
                 relocation action.  For a relocatable file, the value is \
                 the byte offset from the beginning of the section to the \
                 storage unit affected by the relocation.  For an executable \
                 file or shared object, the value is the virtual address of \
                 the storage unit affected by the relocation. \
 \
       r_info    This member gives both the symbol table index with respect \
                 to which the relocation must be made and the type of \
                 relocation to apply.  Relocation types are processor- \
                 specific.  When the text refers to a relocation entry's \
                 relocation type or symbol table index, it means the result \
                 of applying ELF[32|64]_R_TYPE or ELF[32|64]_R_SYM, \
                 respectively, to the entry's r_info member. \
 \
       r_addend  This member specifies a constant addend used to compute the \
                 value to be stored into the relocatable field. \
 \
       The .dynamic section contains a series of structures that hold \
       relevant dynamic linking information.  The d_tag member controls the \
       interpretation of d_un. \
 \
           typedef struct { \
               Elf32_Sword    d_tag; \
               union { \
                   Elf32_Word d_val; \
                   Elf32_Addr d_ptr; \
               } d_un; \
           } Elf32_Dyn; \
           extern Elf32_Dyn _DYNAMIC[]; \
 \
           typedef struct { \
               Elf64_Sxword    d_tag; \
               union { \
                   Elf64_Xword d_val; \
                   Elf64_Addr  d_ptr; \
               } d_un; \
           } Elf64_Dyn; \
           extern Elf64_Dyn _DYNAMIC[]; \
 \
       d_tag     This member may have any of the following values: \
 \
                 DT_NULL     Marks end of dynamic section \

                 DT_NEEDED   String table offset to name of a needed library \

                 DT_INIT     Address of the initialization function \
 \
                 DT_FINI     Address of the termination function \
 \
                 DT_SONAME   String table offset to name of shared object \
 \
                 DT_RPATH    String table offset to library search path \
                             (deprecated) \
 \
                 DT_SYMBOLIC Alert linker to search this shared object \
                             before the executable for symbols \

 \
                 DT_PLTREL   Type of relocation entry to which the PLT \
                             refers (Rela or Rel) \
 \
                 DT_DEBUG    Undefined use for debugging \
 \
                 DT_TEXTREL  Absence of this entry indicates that no \
                             relocation entries should apply to a \
                             nonwritable segment \
 \
                 DT_JMPREL   Address of relocation entries associated solely \
                             with the PLT \

                             relocations before transferring control to the \
                             executable \
 \
                 DT_RUNPATH  String table offset to library search path \
 \
                 DT_LOPROC, DT_HIPROC \
                             Values in the inclusive range [DT_LOPROC, \
                             DT_HIPROC] are reserved for processor-specific \
                             semantics \
 \
       d_val     This member represents integer values with various \
                 interpretations. \
 \
       d_ptr     This member represents program virtual addresses.  When \
                 interpreting these addresses, the actual address should be \
                 computed based on the original file value and memory base \
                 address.  Files do not contain relocation entries to fixup \
                 these addresses. \
 \
       _DYNAMIC  Array containing all the dynamic structures in the .dynamic \
                 section.  This is automatically populated by the linker. \
