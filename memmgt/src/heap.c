 * This is a very fast storage allocator.  It allocates blocks of a small
 * number of different sizes, and keeps free lists of each size.  Blocks that
 * don't exactly fit are passed up to the next larger size.  In this
 * implementation, the available sizes are 2^n-4 (or 2^n-10) bytes long.
 * This is designed for use in a virtual memory environment.
